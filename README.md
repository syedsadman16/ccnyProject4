This project is from CSC10300 Introduction to Computing for Majors class where we covered the C++ programming language. In this project, we formed groups and were tasked with recreating some unix shell commands using a linux distribution such as Arch Linux on virtualbox. I personally used Ubuntu on my local machine.
